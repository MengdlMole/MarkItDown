# Newton Linearized Galerkin Finite Element Methods for Prey-predator Equations

## Abstract

In this study, Newton linearized Galerkin element methods are presented for solving a class of prey-predator eqautions in two- and three-dimensions. The scheme is a one-step, linearized and second-order method in temporal direction. By generalizing the form of the eqautions and using a temporal-spatial splitting skill, the fully discrete scheme is proved to be convergent without time-step restrictions dependent on the spatial mesh size. Numerical examples are given to demonstrate the efficiency of the methods and to confirm the theoretical results.
